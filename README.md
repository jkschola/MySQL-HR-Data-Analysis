## Limitations

- Some records had negative ages. There are 967 records with Age < 0, they have birthdates like '2066-01-07' instead of '1966-01-07'. I Corrected the birthdates by subtracting 100 years and recalculate Age.

- Some termdates were far into the future and were not included in the analysis(1599 records). The only term dates used were those less than or equal to the current date.
